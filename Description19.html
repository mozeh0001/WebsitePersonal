                    <p>For a proposed feasibility study, we conducted a structured process that included User Need Analysis, Market Survey, Conceptualization, Requirements Gathering, and Feasibility Assessment to evaluate the viability of our project from both technical and market perspectives. This process is essential to the course as it mirrors real-world product development, ensuring that connected devices are designed with clear objectives, market viability, and technical feasibility in mind before moving into prototyping and production.</p>
