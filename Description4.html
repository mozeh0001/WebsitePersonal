                    <h2>Lead Programmer | Unity | C#</h2>
                    <p>
                       A game set to be showcased to the USC games expo, Momentum is an action-packed superhero game where you play as a teenage hero with alien-enhanced agility. Equipped with a homeade suit, the player navigates cityscapes, and battles mutants to save civilians. The game features fast-paced traversal, interactive combat, and a compelling narrative. Production is set to finish in Spring 2025 with the collaboration of a small team of pragrammers, artists, UI, narrative, and game desiners.

                    <h1>Civilian Events</h1>
                    <p>
                      Players save civilians from a collapsing building using real-time physics and event-based triggers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After building collapses player has to pick up debris off of player.</li>
                        <li>I implementated a the state machine to manage civilian behavior, transitioning between Patrolling, Hurt, Saved, and Walking to the Door based on enviornmental and player interactions.</li>
                        <li>Players can stop buildings from falling by pressing 'G' on their keyboard in this beta completion.</li>
                        <li>The physics used is triggered based on colliders as when the player goes onto the building the "latch" as they stop it from falling the exact point of grab is gotten by .collision.</li>
                        <li>Camera shakes for real-time interactions when holding building so that player experience is vibrant.</li>
                        <li>States become triggered as enemies in their state machine swarm buildings and attack when player distance is far.</li>

                    <h1>Enemy State Machine</h1>
                    <p>I have programmed two enemies types for this project. One flying and one land enemy.</p>

                     <h2>Land Enemy - Mutant Shrimp</h2>
                    <ul> 
                        <li><strong>Patrol State:</strong> The enemy roams the environment searching for civilians or throwable objects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chase Player State:</strong> If the player is detected within sight range, the enemy aggressively pursues them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pursuing Throwable State:</strong> The enemy locates and moves toward the nearest throwable object, such as a car.</li>
                        <li><strong>Throwing Car State:</strong> If a throwable object is acquired, the enemy stops, aims, and throws it at the player.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attacking Civilians State:</strong> If no player is nearby, the enemy attacks civilians or buildings to cause destruction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jump Up State:</strong> The enemy prepares and executes a vertical jump, often to perform a follow-up attack.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jump Attack State:</strong> After jumping, the enemy slams down towards the player, dealing area damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jump Attack Cooldown State:</strong> The enemy recovers briefly after landing from a jump attack.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dash Player State:</strong> The enemy performs a high-speed charge toward the player if within dash range.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wait For Player State:</strong> The enemy pauses and waits for the player to be vulnerable before attacking.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Transitions:</strong> The enemy switches between states based on player proximity, throwable availability, and civilian presence.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI Behavior:</strong> Uses raycasts and sphere checks for obstacle detection, precise targeting, and environment awareness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Flying Enemy - Prototype</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chase Player State:</strong> The enemy continuously follows the player, maintaining a set distance while avoiding obstacles using NavMesh and raycasting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dash Attack State:</strong> If the player enters a specific attack range, the enemy dashes toward the player in bursts, attempting to strike them.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Transition Logic:</strong> The enemy switches to <em>Dash Attack</em> when the player is within range and back to <em>Chase Player</em> if the player moves too far.</li>
                        <li><strong>Obstacle Avoidance:</strong> Uses sphere casts and raycasts to prevent movement through objects and adjust positioning accordingly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rotation Handling:</strong> The enemy always faces the player while chasing, ensuring its movement is directed properly.</li>
                    </ul>
