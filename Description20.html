                    <p>The theme was "Mystery." Our team had 8 people each will different skill and talent for art, design/narrative, and pragramming. Our game was about a Halloween party since this was around October and fitting for the theme. Everyone was in costumes and you have to guess who your friends are at the party. We created a character mood board and made sure each character costume has their own personality. With team members forming specialized groups based on expertise, we shifted roles as needed throughout the intense two-day development period. </p>
