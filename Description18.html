                        <h2>Spring 2024: Roblox x Open Alpha Game Jam</h2>
                        <h2>Office Oddity</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>The theme was "Wish." Our five-person team, consisting entirely of programmers, had just two days to develop a Roblox game. It follows a character who, on their birthday at work, believes their colleagues have forgottenâ€”only to be surprised by an unexpected celebration. As the game unfolds, a sense of mystery builds, culminating in the player making a wish by blowing out their birthday candles.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>As a team, we developed a progressive story-driven game, carefully planning its structure through a detailed storyboard. This pre-planning process helped us outline key narrative beats, character interactions, and gameplay mechanics, ensuring a cohesive and immersive player experience. The storyboard, shown to the left, served as a visual guide for our development, allowing us to refine our ideas before implementation.</p>
